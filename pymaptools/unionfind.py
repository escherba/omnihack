"""
``UnionFind`` is a method for creating, maintainig, and retrieving disjoint
clusters from a graph. An example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> uf = UnionFind()
    >>> uf.union(0, 1)
    >>> uf.union(2, 3)
    >>> uf.union(3, 0)
    >>> uf.union(4, 5)
    >>> uf.sets()
    [[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]

"""

from collections import defaultdict


class UnionFind(object):
    """Union-find data structure.

    Each unionFind instance X maintains a family of disjoint sets of
    hashable objects, supporting the following two methods:

    - X[item] returns a name for the set containing the given item.
      Each set is named by an arbitrarily-chosen one of its members; as
      long as the set remains unchanged it will keep the same name. If
      the item is not yet part of a set in X, a new singleton set is
      created for it.

    - X.union(item1, item2, ...) merges the sets containing each item
      into a single larger set.  If any item is not yet part of a set
      in X, it is added to X as one of the members of the merged set.

    ::

        >>> uf = UnionFind()
        >>> uf.union(0, 1)
        >>> uf.union(2, 3)
        >>> uf.union(3, 0)
        >>> uf.union(4, 5)
        >>> uf.sets()
        [[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
